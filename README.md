The Guardian News Feed
=============

The Guardian News Feed plug-in enables you to publish articles by the Guardian directly to your blog.

[Download on the Wordpress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-guardian-news-feed/)

Description
-------------

This plugin enables you to publish Guardian articles directly to your blog.

Here are some of the things it does:

- Browse and search for articles to publish

- Post articles (or 'Save to Drafts') directly from your 'Posts' admin panel

- Automatic check-in and replace to make sure you have published the most current version of the article

When publishing articles from the Guardian, please adhere to our publishing guidelines, and be aware of the Terms and Conditions. Guidelines appear in the plug-in admin panel and the T&Cs are on our web site, but here are some reminders:

- Changes. You mustn't remove or alter the text, links or images you get from us.

- Key. If you don't have a key, get one here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform.  It's required.  If you do have one, please don't share it or use it anywhere else.

- Deletions. Sometimes but very rarely we have to remove articles. When that happens, this plug-in will replace the Guardian content within your blog post with a message saying that the content is not available anymore.

Important Notes

This plug-in is designed to be used as is.  We have several ways of working with partners if you want to do something different.  Find out more here:
